## Banking System Case Study

### This project simulates transactions with Simple Friendly Bank via a menu driven user interface.

### The bank is modeled by three classes:  Bank, Customer and Account.  A Bank may have one or many Customers and a Customer may have one or many Accounts.   The Accounts that a Customer may open are CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount, which are subclasses of Account.  To open an account, you must first register as a customer and select a personal identification number (PIN).  You will be issued customer and account ids for future use.

### The type of transactions supported by the accounts are:

### SavingAccount
* deposit
* withdrawal

### CheckingAccount
* deposit
* write check
* order new checks

### Account status information is displayed after each transaction completes.

## To run project, enter python bank.py from the command line.
